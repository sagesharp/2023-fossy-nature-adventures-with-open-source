This repository contains slides for my talk at the 2023 [Free and Open Source Software (FOSSY) conference](https://2023.fossy.us/): "[Nature Adventures with Open Source](https://2023.fossy.us/schedule/presentation/85/)."

In this talk, I share how I use open source tools to find & photograph tide pool creatures. I talk about how I use OpenStreetMap Android (OSMAnd), NOAA tidal prediction data, iNaturalist, and darktable.
